            <h3>Hiccup Haddock - Chief of Berk</h3>
            <p>
                Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III is the main protagonist
                of the DreamWorks animated How to Train Your Dragon
                franchise. He is the son of Valka and the late Hooligan
                chief, Stoick the Vast, thus making him the heir, and
                later, the chief of the tribe. He is 15 years old in the
                first film, Dragons: Riders of Berk and Dragons: Defenders
                of Berk, 18 to 20 years old in Dragons: Race to the Edge,
                20 years old in How to Train Your Dragon 2, 21 years old
                in How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, and 30 in
                the epilogue and Homecoming. His dragon and best friend,
                Toothless, is a Night Fury.
                <br>
                <br>
                By the end of the franchise, he marries Astrid Hofferson
                and they eventually have a daughter, Zephyr, and a son,
                Nuffink. He is also the distant ancestor of Tom Kullersen,
                through his mother Olivia.

            <h3>Toothless - Night Fury</h3>
            <p>
                Toothless is Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III's Night Fury
                and the main dragon character of the How to Train Your
                Dragon franchise. By the end of the franchise, he not
                only becomes the Alpha of the dragons in the Hidden World,
                but also the mate of the Light Fury, the father of the
                Night Lights Dart, Pouncer, and Ruffrunner, and the
                ancestor of the Night Light Thunder.
                <br>
                <br>
                Toothless is playful and intelligent with a puppy-like
                energy. When flying through the dark, he shoots purple
                flames called plasma blasts in all directions, which
                bounce off nearby surfaces to give him an accurate
                reading of his surroundings.

            <h3>Light Fury</h3>
            <p>
                This unnamed Light Fury is a female Light Fury and
                Toothless' mate who first appeared in How to Train Your
                Dragon: The Hidden World.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Light Fury moves as fast as Toothless and shares his
                ability to blend into the sky — even during daylight hours.
                With her white coloration, the Light Fury hides seamlessly
                in clouds, sea fog, and distant horizons.

            <h3>Dart, Pouncer, and Ruffrunner - Night Lights</h3>
            <p>
                Dart, Pouncer, and Ruffrunner are the offspring of Toothless
                and the Light Fury who first appeared in How to Train Your
                Dragon: The Hidden World.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Night Lights are the offspring of Toothless and the Light
                Fury. They live in the Hidden World and share some abilities
                of their parents. Like their parents, Night Lights have powerful
                plasma blasts. They fire first to warn and only openly attack
                when threatened.

                winged-forelimbs that are about the same size as a medium-sized
                theropod dinosaur and small, yellow (yet keen) eyes with black
                pupils.
